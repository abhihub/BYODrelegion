# BYOD Relegion
# Build your own: Relegion/Value-System/Culture
# Immediate goal is to build my own Value-System. 
# Longterm purpose is to get people to build a version of their own Value-System
# Problem this is trying to solve for: all cultures and relegions are inherited across 100s-1000s years. There might be a lot of learning since then that can be applied today to build better value-systems
